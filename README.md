ALX HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAMMING (PYTHON)
=====================================

Welcome to the **ALX Higher Level Programming** repository!

This repository contains solutions to various programming tasks and projects related to Python programming, as part of the **ALX Software Engineering** curriculum.

## Projects

Here is a list of some of the key projects included in this repository:

* **0x00-python-hello_world:** Introduction to Python programming, focusing on basic syntax, variables, and output.

* **0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions:** Explores conditional statements, loops, and function creation in Python.

* **0x02-python-import_modules:** Covers importing modules and using functions from external libraries in Python.

* **0x03-python-data_structures:** Introduces fundamental data structures in Python, such as lists and tuples.

* **0x04-python-more_data_structures:** Expands on data structures, focusing on sets and dictionaries and their applications.

* **0x05-python-exceptions:** Teaches error handling and exception management to create more robust programs.

* **0x06-python-classes:** Introduction to object-oriented programming with classes, instances, and methods in Python.

* **0x07-python-test_driven_development:** Covers writing tests to guide program development using the unittest module.

* **0x08-python-more_classes:** Delves deeper into classes with topics such as operator overloading and private attributes.

* **0x09-python-everything_is_object:** Explores Pythonâ€™s object model and the concept of everything being an object.

* **0x0A-python-inheritance:** Introduces inheritance, enabling code reuse and creating class hierarchies.

* **0x0B-python-input_output:** Focuses on file handling, reading from and writing to files in Python.

* **0x0C-python-almost_a_circle:** A comprehensive project combining Python concepts such as classes, inheritance, and file I/O to create a mini framework for shapes and objects.

* **0x0D-SQL_introduction:** Basics of SQL, including database creation, table management, and simple queries.

* **0x0E-SQL_more_queries:** Advanced SQL queries, covering topics such as joins, subqueries, and constraints.

* **0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping:** Introduces object-relational mapping (ORM) to connect Python code with SQL databases using libraries like SQLAlchemy.

## Technologies

* **Python 3.8.5:** All scripts and projects are written in Python 3.8.5 version.
* **Shell:** For some scripting projects.
* **Bash:** For automating some tasks and running shell commands.
* **Git:** Version control to manage code and track changes.
* **Ubuntu 20.04:** All Python scripts are tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher.
* A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS recommended).
* pycodestyle for Python code linting.
* Basic understanding of Python syntax and OOP principles.
